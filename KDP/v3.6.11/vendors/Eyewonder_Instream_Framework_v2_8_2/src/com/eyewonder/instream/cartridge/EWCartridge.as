Description
-----------
instream vendor-specific cartridge base class. This class is used inside of InstreamFrameworkBase.
A vendor can override with a subclass. For the publisher to interact with the cartridge methods
the vendor provides, the vendor needs to provide the cartridge to the publisher to build into
InstreamFramework.

EyeWonder's vendor cartridge implementation

Example usage
-------------
EyeWonder ad:
var _vendorCartridge:EWCartridge = new EWCartridge();
parent.uif_instreamObject.insertVendorCartridge(_vendorCartridge);



Publisher:
if (_vendorCartridge._vendorName == "EyeWonder")
{
	EWCartridge(_vendorCartridge).__ew_closead();
}
