 * @version 1.2.1 11/05/02
 * @author Marc A. Mnich
 *
 * From www.JavaExchange.com, Open Software licensing
 *
 * 11/05/02 -- Performance enhancement from Mike Dubman.  
 *             Moved InetAddr.getLocal to static block.  Mike has measured
 *             a 10 fold improvement in run time.
 * 01/29/02 -- Bug fix: Improper seeding of nonsecure Random object
 *             caused duplicate GUIDs to be produced.  Random object
 *             is now only created once per JVM.
 * 01/19/02 -- Modified random seeding and added new constructor
 *             to allow secure random feature.
 * 01/14/02 -- Added random function seeding with JVM run time

/*
 * In the multitude of java GUID generators, I found none that
 * guaranteed randomness.  GUIDs are guaranteed to be globally unique
 * by using ethernet MACs, IP addresses, time elements, and sequential
 * numbers.  GUIDs are not expected to be random and most often are
 * easy/possible to guess given a sample from a given generator.
 * SQL Server, for example generates GUID that are unique but
 * sequential within a given instance.
 *
 * GUIDs can be used as security devices to hide things such as
 * files within a filesystem where listings are unavailable (e.g. files
 * that are served up from a Web server with indexing turned off).
 * This may be desirable in cases where standard authentication is not
 * appropriate. In this scenario, the RandomGUIDs are used as directories.
 * Another example is the use of GUIDs for primary keys in a database
 * where you want to ensure that the keys are secret.  Random GUIDs can
 * then be used in a URL to prevent hackers (or users) from accessing
 * records by guessing or simply by incrementing sequential numbers.
 *
 * There are many other possibilities of using GUIDs in the realm of
 * security and encryption where the element of randomness is important.
 * This class was written for these purposes but can also be used as a
 * general purpose GUID generator as well.
 *
 * RandomGUID generates truly random GUIDs by using the system's
 * IP address (name/IP), system time in milliseconds (as an integer),
 * and a very large random number joined together in a single String
 * that is passed through an MD5 hash.  The IP address and system time
 * make the MD5 seed globally unique and the random number guarantees
 * that the generated GUIDs will have no discernible pattern and
 * cannot be guessed given any number of previously generated GUIDs.
 * It is generally not possible to access the seed information (IP, time,
 * random number) from the resulting GUIDs as the MD5 hash algorithm
 * provides one way encryption.
 *
 * ----> Security of RandomGUID: <-----
 * RandomGUID can be called one of two ways -- with the basic java Random
 * number generator or a cryptographically strong random generator
 * (SecureRandom).  The choice is offered because the secure random
 * generator takes about 3.5 times longer to generate its random numbers
 * and this performance hit may not be worth the added security
 * especially considering the basic generator is seeded with a
 * cryptographically strong random seed.
 *
 * Seeding the basic generator in this way effectively decouples
 * the random numbers from the time component making it virtually impossible
 * to predict the random number component even if one had absolute knowledge
 * of the System time.  Thanks to Ashutosh Narhari for the suggestion
 * of using the static method to prime the basic random generator.
 *
 * Using the secure random option, this class complies with the statistical
 * random number generator tests specified in FIPS 140-2, Security
 * Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, section 4.9.1.
 *
 * I converted all the pieces of the seed to a String before handing
 * it over to the MD5 hash so that you could print it out to make
 * sure it contains the data you expect to see and to give a nice
 * warm fuzzy.  If you need better performance, you may want to stick
 * to byte[] arrays.
 *
 * I believe that it is important that the algorithm for
 * generating random GUIDs be open for inspection and modification.
 * This class is free for all uses.
