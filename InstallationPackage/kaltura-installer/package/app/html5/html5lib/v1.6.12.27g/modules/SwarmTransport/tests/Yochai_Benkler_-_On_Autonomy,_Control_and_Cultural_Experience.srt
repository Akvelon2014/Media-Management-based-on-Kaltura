00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Interview with Yochai Benkler

1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,040
When I say user autonomy, what I'm talking about

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:15,920
is at the simplest level the ability 
of people to do more for themselves,

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,920
by themselves, 
without having to ask anyone's permission

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,800
and without having to submit to anyone's

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,840
control over what it is they are doing. 

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:39,480
What happened in the industrial 
information and cultural economy

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:49,480
was that people shifted from being 
relatively free to use a limited range

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:55,440
of materials that they had in social settings 
that were open for conversation.

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,280
Family friends, 
relatively small localities for the majority of people.

10
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,800
To an industrial model of cultural production

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,480
where the materials were produced by 

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:15,400
some set of commercial professional producers, 
who then control the experience 

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:22,400
and located individuals at the passive 
receiving end of the cultural conversation

14
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:29,600
so that efforts to take these materials and remake them, 

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,480
or efforts to participate as a cultural speaker,

16
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,640
by and large required permission.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,200
What we're seeing now is that 
through a combination of technology,

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:52,040
both digital processing and computation technology 
and networking technology,

19
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,080
people can take more of their cultural environment, 

20
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,520
more of the information environment, 
make it their own,

21
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,760
use it as found materials 
to put together their own expressions,

22
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,800
do their own research, 
create their own communications, 

23
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,320
create their own communities, 
when they need collaboration with others.

24
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,480
Rather than relying on a 
limited set of existing institutions.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,840
Or on a set of materials 
that they are not allowed to use

26
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,760
without going and asking 
"please may I use this?

27
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,080
Please may I create?"

28
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,800
What happens when people can do more for and 

29
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,040
by themselves is that the set of actors;

30
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,240
primarily companies, 
and in some places governments

31
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,880
that control the experience - 
those whose permission was required, 

32
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,440
are resisting this transistion because 

33
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,720
control is a good thing to get 
if you can get it. 

34
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,760
Or at least control is a good thing to have 
if you can get it.

35
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:01,080
And what we're seeing today 
is a series of different kinds of campaigns,

36
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,240
Some of them quite self conscious,

37
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,480
I think for example, 
Hollywood's campaign to expand

38
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,640
technological constraint
on use of cultural materials

39
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,400
digital rights management, trusted systems,

40
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,840
is a self conscious campaign.

41
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:27,440
Some of it much less conscious 
much more based on anxieties,

42
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,800
and speaking out anxieties. 
So for example 

43
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,600
when you hear the persistent concerns 
over internet security,

44
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,560
and what will happen if people crack your system

45
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,120
when you hear the constant concerns about quality

46
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,760
and where will good quality come from?

47
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,120
and the error rate in wikipedia, 
these are all much more subconscious expressions

48
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,320
of a fear that ends up being used as justification,

49
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,520
for embracing the control system 
that is being displaced

50
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,320
because of the technological and social actions,

51
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:11,120
because of the technological characteristics 
and the social practices,  

52
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,160
that are being adopted in widespread 
cooperative networked practices. 

53
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:25,040
So we're seeing sometimes legal moves to change,

54
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,640
and require legal control where 
practically it's no longer necessary. 

55
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,640
Sometimes we see... I wouldn't call them propaganda,

56
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,600
but I'd call them public debate and public enactment 

57
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,400
of anxiety, in order to increase the perceived importance,

58
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,480
of the traditional controllers. 
The most important place where you see this is,

59
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,080
teachers tell students not to use Wikipedia.

60
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:02,040
Because that use shakes up the sense that I'm a teacher,

61
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,120
I know exactly what the set of materials are 
that I have approved

62
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,720
and are capable of being approved.

63
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,160
I am used to seeing Kids, 
appealing to authority

64
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,120
rather that cross referencing multiple resources.

65
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,280
I don't want to teach them 
that they should see this as a source,

66
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,400
But not as a source of authority, a source of insight,

67
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,920
a potential move in a research that's always sceptical.  

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,400
One of the things that has to happen 
in the context of the radically decentralised system

69
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,480
Is that we all have to become sceptical beings, 
all the time.

70
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,200
Which is a fundamental change from 
the traditional cultural system 

71
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,840
Where we would talk. 
'How do I know if it's true? Well you've said it.'

72
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,960
Where did they publish it? 
And looking for indicia of authority

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,520
 that will tell me this is authority.

74
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,920
Instead I have to begin to develop new capabilities 

75
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,720
of looking at five sources, 
assigning them different levels of weight

76
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,920
and saying I have reasonable confidence 
that the correct answer is

77
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:15,400
x rather than y without really assigning 
full authority to any single site.

78
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,800
So that's another locus of control trying to,

79
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,720
get people to continue to hang on 
to to this sense that you need

80
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,080
the expert authority, 
you need the person whose is in charge,

81
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,600
to tell you what is good and what is not good. 
what is high quality, what is low quality.

82
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,280
What is reliable information, 
what is not reliable information.

83
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,240
And that's another domain 
where we see the controllers,

84
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:49,200
in this case I think less strategically,

85
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,400
than in the context of the way that for example, 
Hollywood backs digital rights management. 

86
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:02,760
I think it's a cousin in terms of self preservation.

87
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,080
But I think it's also a public enactment 
of deeply held beliefs

88
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,520
about why it is, that the particular people, 
that play a particular role

89
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,280
of authoritative speakers, 
in the older system

90
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,840
continue to believe in the values 
that made them authoritative, 

91
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,120
and made their authority important.  
And so that's much more cultural resistance,

92
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,600
than it is practical, 
legal or technical design resistance.

93
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,080
But  were seeing resistance from 
different kind of actors who played the role, 

94
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,800
of controllers in the older models, 
trying to preserve 

95
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,880
their relatively privileged position as controllers,

96
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,120
through different systems of constraint.
