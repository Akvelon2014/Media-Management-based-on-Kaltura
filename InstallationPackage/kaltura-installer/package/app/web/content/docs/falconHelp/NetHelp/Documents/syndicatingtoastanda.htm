<h3>Syndicating to a Standard MRSS Feed (Yahoo)</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Yahoo is the standard MRSS feed type which can be used by any 
MRSS reader for various use cases. Yahoo also uses the standard MRSS feed to 
submit site maps. For example, if you create an MRSS, you can place the link in 
your site and allow end users to subscribe to the feed, or use the feed for your 
own integration. You can create your own video galleries that refresh when you 
update the feed, as well as integrate the feed to your site, and extract data 
from the feed to display the content, depending on fields you define.Â  
There are many clients (for example all browsers), and desktop applications, and 
site integrations that know how to read MRSS feeds. </p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
