<h3>Defining a Rule</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class="apple-style-span">You can define a rule that 
will result in your playlist content. You can use any number of filters: you can 
define a list of clips that all have the same tag (for example, if you enter the 
term "dog" into the search box and click search, a new rule-based playlist is 
created for all the clips that have the "dog" tag). This list will dynamically 
change each time a clip is added or deleted to/from your account. </span><span class="apple-style-span"><b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial Bold'; FONT-SIZE: 15pt"></span></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class="apple-style-span">For example, you can define a 
rule-based playlist that consists of all the 0-4 minute video clips that were 
created in the past week. In addition to filtering, at the bottom of the window, 
you can define a preferred order for your playlist. You can order it by Most 
Viewed (overall, last week or last 24 hours) or Most Recent (for example, most 
recently added to the KMC). </span><span class="apple-style-span"><b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial Bold'; FONT-SIZE: 15pt"></span></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class="apple-style-span">If, for example, you would 
like to create a dynamic playlist that at any given moment consists of the most 
viewed clips in the last week, all you need to do is create a new filter and 
select the "Most Viewed 7 Days" option from the "Order by" drop-down menu. 
</span><span class="apple-style-span"><b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial Bold'; FONT-SIZE: 15pt"></span></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class="apple-style-span">On the bottom of the playlist 
you can see the number of entries in the playlist and their total length. You 
can automatically limit the number of entries that are included in the playlist 
by adjusting the counter positioned to the right of the "Order by" drop-down 
menu. </span><span class="apple-style-span"><b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial Bold'; FONT-SIZE: 15pt"></span></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Your playlist can be based on a single rule or multiple 
rules.<span class="apple-style-span"> If you want to apply more than one rule to 
</span>your playlist, click the "Switch to Advanced Mode" link at the bottom of 
the window. Note that this will clear all previous information that you have 
saved in your playlist.</p>
