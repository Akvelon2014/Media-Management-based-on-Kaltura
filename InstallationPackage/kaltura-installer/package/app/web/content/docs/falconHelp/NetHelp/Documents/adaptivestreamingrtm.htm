<h3><a name="_Adaptive_Streaming_RTMP" id="_Adaptive_Streaming_RTMP"></a>Adaptive Streaming RTMP Delivery with 
Adaptive Bitrate</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR) streaming is a technique of detecting 
a viewer's bandwidth capabilities in real time, and then adjusting the quality 
of the video stream accordingly, always delivering the best possible picture 
quality. ABR streaming results in less buffering, fast start time and an overall 
better experience for both high-speed and low-speed connections. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">ABR dynamically shifts bandwidth to higher and lower levels 
based on availability. For Adaptive Bitrate Streaming to work, a video is first 
encoded at different bitrates to accommodate varying bandwidth connections. Each 
bitrate version is sliced up into tiny fragments — typically 2 to 10 
seconds. The Kaltura player pulls fragments from the different encodings and 
inserts them into the stream as bandwidth dictates resulting in faster video 
start times and a continuous, uninterrupted video experience.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For example, a movie called The “Big Movie” is streaming. The 
end user would view a smoothly playing video. Unknown to the user, multiple 
streams are actually available and may be seamlessly switched to, if their 
connection drops lower or improves.  The key here is “seamless”. When 
adaptive bit streaming is done correctly, there should be no interruption of 
playback. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For The Big Movie, a player might be serving up the following 
all at once:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Big Movie @ 2612 kbps</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Big Movie @ 1600 kbps</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Big Movie @ 1200 kbps</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Big Movie @ 800 kbps</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading0">USE CASE</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If a user’s connection dropped from over 2.5 Mbps to 
1600kbps, the Kaltura player would switch, again seamlessly, from the 2612 bit 
rate down to the 1600. Often the Kaltura player is designed to begin playing 
using the lowest possible bit rate so that playback starts immediately. For this 
example, the 800 kbps stream might be served up first and then as the Kaltura 
player realizes that the user can handle a higher bitrate, the streaming rate 
would then be switched up higher. </p>
