Session</h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Often, the user authentication/entitlement mechanism that 
decides whether a user is entitled to access a specific media entry or not, will 
reside outside of Kaltura. When the authentication mechanism resides outside 
Kaltura, we recommend that you use an Advanced Kaltura Session (KS) based Access 
Control mechanism, that permits access to the media only when a valid Kaltura 
Session is provided. .The external entitlement mechanism will then generate the 
valid Kaltura Session when users should be permitted to view the content.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The session is created using a secret. The external 
entitlement mechanism will then generate the valid KS when users should be 
permitted to view the content. Common examples include - </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When implementing paid content where the payment gateway is 
not Kaltura, the server processing the payment will be the mechanism deciding on 
entitlement. After the payment is processed, the payment server creates a valid 
Kaltura Session by calling the Kaltura API and passes that KS to the Kaltura 
player.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When implementing a single-sign-on and permissions 
mechanism using LDAP or other authentication mechanism outside of Kaltura, the 
server responsible for user authentication contains the entitlement logic. The 
authentication server will call the Kaltura API and generate a valid KS when 
appropriate.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A Kaltura Player marked with tokenized access requires a 
“session token” to be created and provided during every playback. A session 
token can only be created by a developer possessing valid credentials and 
expires after a limited amount of time. Thus, even if an attempt to grab the 
item’s direct URL is successful, the playback session will soon expire and 
without possession of the valid credentials, regeneration of a new token will 
not be possible.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This option is useful to prevent scraping of content from 
your website or re-sharing of content on other sites that are not yours and 
provides an additional amount of security to content display.</p>
