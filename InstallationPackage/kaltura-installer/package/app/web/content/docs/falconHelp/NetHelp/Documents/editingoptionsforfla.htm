<h2>Editing Options for Flavors in a Transcoding Profile</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">The following options may be edited for each transcoding 
flavor selected in a Transcoding Profile:</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -18.6pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 21.7pt; tab-stops: 41.4pt" class="MsoListBullet"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">•</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; VISIBILITY: hidden">      
</span><b>Impact on Entry Readiness</b> –Determines the impact of each specific 
transcoding flavor on entry readiness for publishing. See <a class="topic-link" href="quickpublishing.htm">Quick Publishing</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The options are:</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -18.6pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 41.4pt; tab-stops: 41.4pt" class="MsoListBulletCxSpFirst"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">•</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; VISIBILITY: hidden">      
</span><b>Required</b> – The entry will not be set to a Ready state until the 
processing of the specific transcoding flavor is complete. To expedite video 
readiness we recommend applying the ‘Required’ setting to a single flavor that 
is required for playback on each required environment. For example, if the 
source file is an MOV that cannot be played on the web, flagging only one lowest 
quality FLV or MP4 flavor as ‘Required’ will  ensure the video will be 
published as quickly as possible while the other flavors are being prepared.</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -18.6pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 41.4pt; tab-stops: 41.4pt" class="MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">•</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; VISIBILITY: hidden">      
</span><b>Optional</b> – The entry may be set to a Ready state before the 
processing of the specific transcoding flavor is complete. When no other 
Transcoding Flavor within the Transcoding Profile is set as required, completion 
of the processing of any Optional flavor sets the entry to the Ready state. We 
recommend using this option for most flavors to increase speed of readiness. 
</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -18.6pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 41.4pt; tab-stops: 41.4pt" class="MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">•</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; VISIBILITY: hidden">      
</span><b>No Impact</b> – Determining entry readiness is not affected by the 
presence of this transcoding flavor. This is usually the default setting for the 
“Source” transcoding flavor.</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -18.6pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 41.4pt; tab-stops: 41.4pt" class="MsoListBulletCxSpLast"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">•</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; VISIBILITY: hidden">      
</span><b>Use Kaltura Transcoding</b> – Determines whether to use the Kaltura 
transcoding engine for generating each specific transcoding flavor. This option 
is enabled only when your account is set to support the ingestion of multiple 
bit-rate transcoding flavors generated by your local transcoder.  If 
Kaltura performs transcoding of all flavors except the ‘source’ file, this 
option should be set to <b>Always</b>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The options are:</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -18.6pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 41.4pt; tab-stops: 41.4pt" class="MsoListBulletCxSpFirst"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">•</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; VISIBILITY: hidden">      
</span><b>Always</b> – Kaltura’s transcoding engine always is used for 
generating the specific Transcoding Flavor.</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -18.6pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 41.4pt; tab-stops: 41.4pt" class="MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">•</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; VISIBILITY: hidden">      
</span><b>Never</b> – The Kaltura transcoding engine will not generate the 
specific transcoding flavor. This is a fixed setting for the “Source Flavor” 
which always is added to the entry with no additional processing. This option 
should also be used when your account’s content ingestion workflow relies on a 
local transcoding engine and when the ingestion of the previously transcoded 
Flavor to Kaltura should always take place, bypassing Kaltura’s conversion 
processing.</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -18.6pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 41.4pt; tab-stops: 41.4pt" class="MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">•</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; VISIBILITY: hidden">      
</span><b>As a Fall-back</b> – The system expects to add this transcoding flavor 
from a local transcoding engine, but will use Kaltura’s transcoding engine as a 
fall-back to convert to this flavor when the flavor is not received as part of 
the ingestion request. This option adds flexibility when you want to use your 
local transcoding engine while utilizing Kaltura’s transcoding engine as a 
fall-back option.</p>

</span><b>System Name (Optional) – </b>The system name is used to identify the 
flavor in client-side applications. For example, to mark a specific flavor as 
suitable for playback on iPad devices, the system name was set to 
iPad.<b></b></p>

</span></span><b>Flavor Generation Policy</b> – <span class="BodyTextChar">You can 
bypass Kaltura’s transcoding optimization, and force specific flavors to be 
generated even when they are detected as redundant by the Kaltura transcoding 
optimization module.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt" class="MsoListBullet2CxSpFirst"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">o  
</span>Use Kaltura’s Optimization - Kaltura’s optimization routine decides 
whether it is worth-while to create a flavor (For example if the source video is 
of lesser quality than the flavor, the optimization routine will not create the 
flavor).</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 54pt; tab-stops: 54.0pt" class="MsoListBullet2CxSpLast"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">o  
</span>Force Flavor generation –Select this option to override the Kaltura 
optimization routine and create a flavor regardless of whether or not it is 
redundant quality wise (For example, when a publisher has to distribute the 
video through a broadcast channel that requires specific flavor specifications, 
the flavor must be created.)</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
