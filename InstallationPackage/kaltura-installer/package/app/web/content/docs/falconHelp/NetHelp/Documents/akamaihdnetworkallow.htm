<h3>Akamai HD Network – Allows adaptive bit-rate</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class="BodyTextChar">Akamai's advanced adaptive bitrate 
streaming technology intelligently adjusts the bit rate of a video stream to 
ensure the optimum playback quality based on changing bandwidth conditions. It 
also allows for flavor switching without the loss of content. </span>You <span class="BodyTextChar">can send streaming video over HTTP from an ordinary web 
server for playback on iPhone and iPad, or other devices, such as desktop 
computers, without the limitations of Progressive Downloads. <br /><br />The 
Akamai HD streaming protocol supports Multiple Bitrates and adaptively switches 
to the optimal bit-rate based on network conditions for a smooth quality 
playback experience. An optional feature with this selected delivery setting is 
that the implementation also provides for media encryption and user 
authentication over HTTPS, allowing publishers to protect their 
work.</span><span style="COLOR: white; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt"><br /></span><span class="BodyTextChar"><br />The Akamai HD Network is designed and optimized for 
large-scale broadcasters and film distributors to increase audience engagement 
and expand revenues by complementing traditional mediums such as TV and DVD with 
the Internet.</span></p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
