one public gallery (Content Privacy = No Restriction) will be visible to

Search or via a direct link to the MediaSpace page of this

least one</u> organizational shared gallery (Content Privacy = Requires 
Authentication), will be visible to all members of the organization (following 
login to the portal) from the organizational shared gallery page itself, but 
also via the portal’s Global Search or via a direct link to the MediaSpace page

</span>A video that is published in a few private channels but is also set in 
Kaltura categories managed in the KMC account that are not integrated with the 
media portal (for example, categories integrated with Kaltura extensions to 
CMS/LMS, categories set by the account KMC administrator for different purposes, 
etc.). Access to the video via the Media Portal is determined only by the 
entitlements settings of the categories the Media Portal is integrated with. 
This is controlled by the application specific “privacy content” label set to 
these categories.</p>
