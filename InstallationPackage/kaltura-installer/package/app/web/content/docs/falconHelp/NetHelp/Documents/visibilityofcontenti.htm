<h3>Visibility of Content in Outside of the Application</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">When the entitlement feature is enabled for the account, an 
internal enforcement level is also set and managed by Kaltura.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The options for entitlement enforcement are:</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -18.75pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">•</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; VISIBILITY: hidden">      
</span><b>Entitlement enforcement is enabled by default.</b><b></b></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">When entitlement enforcement is enabled for the 
account - access to content under categories with entitlement is only possible 
via applications that implement entitlement and are integrated with these 
categories. This is the recommended setting in MediaSpace accounts for the 
highest level of content security.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph"><b>Note</b>: that embed codes that are grabbed by 
authorized users from within the MediaSpace application are bypassing the 
entitlement enforcement for the specific entry. Thus the entry will become 
publically available within the grabbed player outside of MediaSpace.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph"> </p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -18.75pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">•</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; VISIBILITY: hidden">      
</span><b>Entitlement enforcement is disabled by default and enabled by the 
application.</b></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">When entitlement enforcement is disabled for account - 
access to content under categories with entitlement is possible via any 
application, including player embed codes that are grabbed from the KMC. With 
this option the application itself activate the entitlement enforcement so 
entitlement rules are kept within the application but all content in categories 
the application is integrated with can be accessed via other applications as 
well. This is the default setting for Kaltura trial accounts.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph"><u><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none"></span></u> </p>

level for your account.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
