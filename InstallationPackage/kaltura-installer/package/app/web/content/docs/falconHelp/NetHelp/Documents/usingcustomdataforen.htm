<h4>Using Custom Data for Entries</h4>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As a best practice we recommend richly mapping your media 
assets with metadata to make your assets more findable and better used as 
business objects.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can fill in the values for the defined schema for each 
media asset (entry). The UI elements are built per the field type supporting 
text fields, checkboxes for multiple selections (from predefined values list), 
date selector (for date fields), text list (for multiple value fields), and 
linked entries (for creating structure).<span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri','sans-serif'"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The schemas you customize may be used for viewing and 
editing, as well as for filtering, search, and syndication rules. Custom data 
may be used as a condition for distributing content. For example if you are 
trying to distribute data and a custom data field has been defined and expected 
by the distribution channel, if the custom data is not received, the content 
will not be distributed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Searching (and creating syndication rules) by a custom field 
is integrated into the KMC UI and workflows. Â </p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
