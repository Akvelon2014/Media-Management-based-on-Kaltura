<p class="MsoNormal">Kaltura’s Remote Storage and Delivery solution enables 
publishers to manage their video assets and account settings on Kaltura’s hosted 
video platform while actually storing the content on their own remote network 
storage location, and delivering the content from the same remote 
location.  Kaltura’s remote storage and delivery capabilities are fully 
integrated with the platform’s ingestion, transcoding and publishing 
work­flows, and provide system fl­exibility for addressing publishers’ 
specific storage and delivery needs. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can link content to remote storage from the KMC User 
Interface. The Link to Remote Storage option is useful for partners that use 
their own transcoder and also host and deliver content on/from a remote storage 
(e.g. CDN storage, internal organization storage). The partner’s transcoder 
generates the flavors. After the files are uploaded directly to the remote 
storage it is only necessary to indicate which flavors to link to an entry in 
Kaltura.  The connection of the remote storage profile to the transcoding 
profile is used for this purpose<span style="COLOR: #1f497d">.  </span></p>
