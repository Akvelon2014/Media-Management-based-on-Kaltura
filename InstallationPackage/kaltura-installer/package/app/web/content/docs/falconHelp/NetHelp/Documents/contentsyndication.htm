<h2>Content Syndication<a name="Content_Syndication" id="Content_Syndication"></a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Content syndication is a way of making your content available 
to multiple other sources. This creates a form of leverage that gives you the 
ability to create your content once while maximizing your exposure on the 
Internet by distributing your content in many places at the same time. Content 
syndication is a win-win for both the publisher and the webmaster. As a result 
of this type of distribution, publishers receive increasingly more exposure for 
their content and webmasters receive new source for additional content.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Kaltura allows you to create video feeds in multiple formats 
that are ready for submission to 3<sup>rd</sup> party platforms such as Google, 
Yahoo!, iTunes and other video sharing sites and social networks. Â Videos 
are distributed via playlist feeds (such as MRSS) to the channels of your 
choice. The content remains on the Kaltura host.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">RSS syndicates your web content to other sites and builds 
inbound links, making RSS one of the most effective SEO strategies today. Using 
RSS as part of your SEO strategy is advantageous. If you need help with web 
content syndication, contact your account manager.</p>
