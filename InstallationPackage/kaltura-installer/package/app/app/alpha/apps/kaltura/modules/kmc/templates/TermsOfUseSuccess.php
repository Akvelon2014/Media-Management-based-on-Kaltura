		<div class="title"><a href="#sec0">Top</a><h2>4. License to Use the Services</h2></div>
		<p>Subject to your acceptance of and compliance with this Agreement and with the payment requirements for the Services that are set forth on the applicable Service detail page on the Kaltura Website (as such payment terms may be updated from time to time), we hereby grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable right and license, in and under our intellectual property rights, to access and use the Services, solely in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
		<h4>4.1. Permitted Uses.</h4><br />
			<p class="indent"><strong>4.1.1.</strong> You may use the Kaltura Interactive Widgets in order to access the Services.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>4.1.2.</strong> You may write an application ("Application") that interfaces with the Services. You acknowledge that we may change, deprecate or republish APIs (as defined in Section 6.1 below) for any Service or feature of a Service from time to time, and that it is your responsibility to ensure that calls you make to any Service are compatible with then-current APIs for the Service.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>4.1.3.</strong> You may make network calls or requests to the Services at any time that the Services are available.</p>
		<h4>4.2. Restricted Uses.</h4><br />
			<p class="indent"><strong>4.2.1.</strong> You may not interfere or attempt to interfere in any manner with the functionality or proper working of the Services.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>4.2.2.</strong> You may not remove, obscure, or alter any notice of any Mark, or other intellectual property or proprietary right appearing on or contained within the Services or on any Kaltura Properties.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>4.2.3.</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you may generally publicize your use of the Services; however, you may not issue any press release with respect to the Services or this Agreement without our prior written consent.</p>
		<h4>4.3. Accounts and Keys.</h4>
		<p>Unless otherwise stated in an applicable AUP, you may only create one account per email address. Kaltura accounts are associated with one or more public key/private key pairs, which are used to access the service. When you complete the account creation process, 
			you will be issued unique account identifiers ("Account Identifiers"), and may add a public key to your account. Account Identifiers (i) identify your account and (ii) allow you to make requests to Kaltura. The Account Identifier is immutable and will always uniquely identify your Kaltura account. 
			Public key/private key pairs are unique to your account and are subject to change. Private keys are for your personal use only, and you may not sell, transfer, sublicense or otherwise disclose your private key to any other party. You may use your public key in the open in requests to Kaltura;
			your public key is therefore not secret. However, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy and security of your private key. You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your Account Identifiers, regardless of whether such activities are undertaken by you or a third party.
			Therefore, you should contact us immediately if you believe a third party may be using your private key, or if your private key is otherwise lost or stolen. You are responsible for maintaining up-to-date and accurate information (including contact information) for your Kaltura account.
			We are not responsible for any unauthorized access to, alteration of, or the deletion, destruction, damage, loss or failure to store any of, Your Content (as defined in Section 10.2), your Applications, or other data which you submit or use in connection with your account or the Services.
		</p>
		<h4>4.4. Monitoring Your Use of the Kaltura Web Services.</h4>
		<p>You agree to provide information and/or other materials related to your Applications as reasonably requested by us to verify your compliance with this Agreement. You further acknowledge and agree that, with respect to:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>4.4.1.</strong> <em>Online Applications</em>, we may monitor the external interfaces of your Application for the purpose of verifying your compliance with this Agreement; and</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>4.4.2.</strong> <em>Client-Side Applications</em>, you agree to furnish a copy of your Application upon request for the purpose of verifying your compliance with this Agreement.</p>
