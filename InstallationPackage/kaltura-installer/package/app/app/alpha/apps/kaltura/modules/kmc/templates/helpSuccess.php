						<div class="dataTitle" id="contentSection185"><a href="#main">Back to top</a><h4><span>1.8.5</span>Video Transcoding Settings</h4></div>
						<p>
							This is where you can select the settings for your video transcoding, i.e. how the videos that you are uploading will be transcoded when uploaded to Kaltura’s servers. 
							Videos which are uploaded in different formats are automatically transcoded to FLV files by the system. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The main consideration in selecting your transcoding settings is the tradeoff between size and quality. 
							Higher quality videos require larger files that may cause buffering events during playback.  
							Additional parameters that need to be taken into consideration are the quality of the source video file uploaded, 
							the amount of movement in the video (higher movement requires higher quality, for example sports videos) 
							and the size of the player in which the video will be played.
						</p>
						<p>
							The transcoding settings allow you to control and manipulate all these parameters. These settings will take effect for all upload sessions via the management console unless you change them for each upload session.
						</p>
						<h5>Transcoder Selection</h5>
						<p>
							Kaltura uses a variety of transcoding tools both open source and commercial. Commercial transcoders typically provide 
							improved quality and smaller file sizes which result in smoother playback and less buffering events.
						</p>
						<h5>Available Encoding Formats:</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>Standard Web Quality FLV (Bitrate: 400kbps)&ndash; minimal in size, loads fast with minimal buffering events, best for videos with little movement. Appropriate for 750kbps connection</li>
							<li>Good Web Quality FLV (Bitrate: 800kbps)&ndash; presents a good balance between file size and quality. Appropriate for 1500kbps connection</li>
							<li>Excellent Web Quality FLV (Bitrate: 1200kbps)&ndash; may result in a relatively large file, appropriate for videos with a lot of movement. Appropriate for 3000kbps connection and above</li>
							<li>HD Content H264 &ndash; maximum quality. May create a long loading time & buffering events when playing online. Could be used for download for offline viewing.</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Remixing Quality</h5>
						<p>
							If you are uploading videos that are intended for remixing and editing with Kaltura’s online editing tools, the Kaltura servers will optimize the settings to support remixing. 
							If you are uploading videos that are intended for viewing only, it is recommended to keep this unchecked.
						</p>
						
						<div class="dataTitle" id="contentSection186"><a href="#main">Back to top</a><h4><span>1.8.6</span>Aspect Ratio</h4></div>
						<p>
							The aspect ratio is the ratio between the width and the height of the video. Most common ratios are:
							<br />
							(i) 4:3 &ndash; normal screen; and
							<br />
							(ii) 16:9 &ndash; wide screen. When playing a wide screen video in a normal (4:3) screen there will be black margins on the video. 
							In most cases, keeping the original ratio is the best configuration.
						</p>
						
						<div class="dataTitle" id="contentSection187"><a href="#main">Back to top</a><h4><span>1.8.7</span>Optimize Video Viewing</h4></div>
						<p>
							By checking the “Optimize Video Viewing” box, you can select to transcode the original video into a smaller file that is set to the specific size of the video player. 
							If not checked, the size of the original file will be maintained. 
							Note that this is an advanced setting that can help save on hosting and streaming, however it is recommended to use this only if the size of the player is definite.
						</p>
						
						<div class="dataTitle" id="contentSection188"><a href="#main">Back to top</a><h4><span>1.8.8</span>ByPass Transcoding for content in FLV format</h4></div>

							This is useful when you have already optimized the content in its FLV format.
