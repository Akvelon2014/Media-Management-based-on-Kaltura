IMPORTANT CHANGES
-----------------
Zend_Http_Client:
A change was made in Zend_Http_Client to correct ZF-5744 (Multiple file uploads
using the same $formname in setFileUpload). Instead of returning an associative
array of element name => upload information pairs, it now returns an array of
arrays, with the element name as part of the upload information. This allows
multiple file uploads using the same element name.

Zend_Config_Xml:
One deciding factor for many when choosing which Zend_Config format to use for
their application config had to do with support for constants. Our application
recommendations include defining two constants, APPLICATION_ENV and
APPLICATION_PATH, and many developers have found it useful that in INI and PHP
configurations, these constants are expanded during parsing. Zend_Config_Xml
now supports this via an XML namespace as follows:

    <config xmlns:zf="http://framework.zend.com/xml/zend-config-xml/1.0/">
        <production>
            <includePath><zf:const
                zf:name="APPLICATION_PATH"/>/library</includePath>
        </production>
    </config>

On the PHP side, nothing changes.

Zend_Translate_Adapter_Ini:
Prior to PHP 5.3, parse_ini_file() and parse_ini_string() handled non-ASCII
characters in INI option values without an issue. However, starting in PHP 5.3,
such options will now be silently dropped in the array returned. If you are
upgrading to PHP 5.3 and using Zend_Translate_Adapter_Ini, this could cause
potential issues for you. If you use UTF-8 or Latin-1 characters in your INI
option keys (which are the message IDs for translation), you should either
modify these to use only ASCII characters, or choose a different translation
adapter.

Zend_Service_Amazon:
Zend_Service_Amazon has been updated to comply with the latest Amazon
ECommerce APIs -- which, as of 15 August 2009, will require an API key
for authentication. As a result, if you now use Zend_Service_Amazon, you
will need to pass your API key to the Zend_Service_Amazon constructor:
    
    $amazon = new Zend_Service_Amazon($appId, $countryCode, $apiKey);

Otherwise, usage of this component remains the same.
