    <td><a href="#entry">Entry</a></td>
    <td>An entry is a media entity and its meta-data on the Kaltura servers. It can be an image, a sound clip, a video file or a rough-cut (explained below) wrapped with vast information such as dates, titles, tags, ratings and more. The Kaltura extensive API enables its partners to create galleries, lists, playlists and more by calling up various entry-related API calls as well as edit this information on the fly.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rough-cut</td>
    <td>
A rough-cut is a 'mix' type entry. Similar to a video type entry, you can play a rough-cut in the Kaltura Dynamic Player (KDP) - It can be a single or a mix of videos, a slide-show, a mix of both and much more.<br />
A rough-cut is an XML unique format invented by Kaltura, similar to Final Cut Pro 'Edit Decision List' but with a twist. Whenever a user uses the Kaltura Editor to create a mix of videos and images, in and out points, transitions, text overlays, soundtrack, effects and much more - the Kaltura Editor automatically saves this mix as a rough-cut. The user can then play the rough-cut in a Kaltura video player as if it was an ordinary (yet very cool) video.</td>

  <tr class="odd">
    <td><a href="#widget">Widget</a></td>
